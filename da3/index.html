<h2>Amethyst Hour</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I think I implemented the thematic elements in a unique way. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype? Learned how to spawn enemies at certain time intervals also used groups collision. 
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? There is a feature I didn't get to implement and will hopefully implement in a future iteration but 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>The code for this example is adapted from the <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/v2.6.2/resources/Project%20Templates/Basic">Phaser Basic Project Template</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Catch the fainting stars...
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
<li>Fainter</li> 
<li>Caught</li>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Keyboard input, high randomness, 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Catching falling objects. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
This is a relatively simple game, but I think there's room to increase the difficulty, which I plan to do with further iterations. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can use the left and right arrow keys on their keyboard to move the cloud and try to catch the falling stars. Blue stars are worth 10 points, gold stars are worth 5. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Prioritizing the blue stars. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
If stars wore corsets too would they drop out of the sky? 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Casual gamers. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Until the player gets bored. 
</li>
